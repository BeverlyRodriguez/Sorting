# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of several common sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

### 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

### 2. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one item at a time. It iterates through the input list, removing one element at a time and finds the place where the element belongs in the sorted list and inserts it there.

### 3. Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It divides the input list into two halves, sorts the halves recursively, and then merges them back together. It has a time complexity of O(n log n).

### 4. Quick Sort
Quick Sort is also a divide and conquer algorithm that partitions the input list into smaller sublists, those less than a chosen pivot element and those greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sublists. It has an average time complexity of O(n log n).

### 5. Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and moves it to the beginning. The algorithm maintains two sublists in a given input list: a sublist of elements already sorted and the remaining sublist of elements to be sorted.


## How to Use
Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own Python file. To use any of these sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Choose the sorting algorithm you want to use.
4. Run the corresponding Python file with Python 3.
